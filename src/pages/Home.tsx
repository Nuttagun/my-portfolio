            I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student skilled in both
            frontend and backend development using TypeScript, Go, React, and
            UX/UI design with Figma. Experienced in API development, Git,
            RESTful APIs, and databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. I
            am highly motivated, adaptable, and thrive under pressure, with a
            strong commitment to continuous self-improvement and growth in this
            field. My goal is to contribute to cloud-based solutions at TCC
            Technology.
